# TASK DESCRIPTION:
       This task is all about creating a simple and engaging text-based Hangman game using core Python programming concepts. The goal is to allow the user to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, within a limited number of attempts. With just basic tools like console input and output, this game provides a hands-on way to apply loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and list operations—all fundamental elements of Python.

The game begins by randomly selecting a word from a small predefined list of five fruits: 'apple', 'grape', 'mango', 'peach', and 'berry'. This avoids the need for file handling or external APIs, keeping the focus on logic development. The chosen word is then hidden from the player, represented by underscores, and the player has up to 6 incorrect guesses to figure it out.

As the game progresses, the player is prompted to guess one letter at a time. If the guessed letter is in the word, all instances of that letter are revealed in the correct positions. If not, the number of remaining attempts decreases. The game includes helpful features like input validation, a warning for repeated guesses, and clear feedback on every input.

The game ends when either the word is fully guessed (win condition) or the player runs out of attempts (loss condition). This project helps learners understand control flow, list indexing, and user interaction in a fun and rewarding way.

Whether you're a beginner looking to strengthen your Python skills or just someone who enjoys building classic games, this Hangman task is a perfect coding exercise to practice logic, loops, and problem-solving—all while having fun!
